# Flicks

## Basics
A flick (frame-tick) is a very small unit of time. It is 1/705600000 of a second, exactly.

    1 flick = 1/705600000 second

This unit of time is the smallest time unit which is LARGER than a nanosecond,
and can in integer quantities exactly represent a single frame duration for
24hz, 25hz, 30hz, 48hz, 50hz, 60hz, 90hz, 100hz, 120hz, and also 1/1000 divisions of each.
This makes it suitable for use via std::chrono::duration and std::ratio for doing timing work
against the system high resolution clock, which is in nanoseconds, but doesn't get slightly
out of sync when doing common frame rates.

In order to accomodate media playback, we also support some common audio sample rates
as well. This list is not exhaustive, but covers the majority of digital audio formats.
They are 8kHz, 16kHz, 22.05kHz, 24kHz, 32kHz, 44.1kHz, 48kHz, 88.2kHz, 96kHz, and 192kHz.
While humans can't hear higher than 48kHz, the higher sample rates are used for working
audio files which might later be resampled or retimed.

The NTSC variations (~29.97, etc) are actually defined as 24 * 1000/1001 and 30 * 1000/1001,
which are impossible to represent exactly in a way where 1 second is exact, so we don't
bother - they'll be inexact in any circumstance.

## Motivation

When working creating visual effects for film, television, and other media, it is common
to run simulations or other time-integrating processes which subdivide a single frame of time
into a fixed, integer number of subdivisions. It is handy to be able to accumulate these 
subdivisions to create exact 1-frame and 1-second intervals, for a variety of reasons. 

Knowing that you should never, ever use floating point representations for accumulated, 
simulated time (lest your temporal accuracy degrade over time), the std::chrono time tools
in C++ are ideal. However, the highest usable resolution, nanoseconds, doesn't evenly divide
common film & media framerates. This was the genesis of this unit.

## Limitations 

This implementation uses c++11s `std::chrono::nanoseconds` to represent a flicks numerator. C++11 defines `std::chrono::nanoseconds::rep` as "A signed integral type of at least 64 bits". Therefore a `flicks` is capable of representing absolute time values of more than 414 years into the future (and past) relative to an epoch before an integer overflow occurs. 705600000 also fits easily into a 32 bit signed type, making a flick suitable to be used in many modern media containers, protocols and applications.

## Acknowledgements

This time unit began as a technical question posted publicly on Facebook by Christopher Horvath
in early 2017. Many people contributed and refined the unit, including Dan Goldman, Pascal Pincosy,
Simon Eves, Kearsley Higgins, Francisco De La Torre, Benjy Feen, Eric Landreneau and Sebastian Sylwan,
among others. Here's the post!

## Installation
Just place flicks.h wherever you install C++ header files - this is a header only library. Flicks are placed
in the "util" namespace here, for lack of a clear alternative. It would be nice if they were in std:: someday.

## Derivation
A C++ file which implements a derivation of flicks is provided - it is not required to use the library,
but only to show how it was derived. A brute-force approach was intentionally used. To compile, assuming
you have a C++ compiler installed, just do this:

    > c++ -o flicks_derivation flicks_derivation.cpp -std=c++14; ./flicks_derivation

## Test
A C++ file which tests flicks is provided - it is not required to use the library,
but only to test the unit. To compile, assuming you have a C++ compiler installed, just do this:

    > c++ -o flicks_test flicks_test.cpp -std=c++14; ./flicks_test

## Makefile
A makefile is provided that works on a Linuxy system or OSX, but not Windows. To use it:

    > make

To clean up:

    > make clean
